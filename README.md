MyChow is going to be the product of fogetful food ordering...

Remember what you ordered from that Chinese place 3 weeks ago? 
Was that burrito any good from that spot around the corner? 
Want a place you can just remember if you want Poke or not? 

MyChow takes the places you've been. Lets you write whatever you want then, when / if you order from there again, you know what to (or not) get.
